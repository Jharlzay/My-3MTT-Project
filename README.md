When a particular plate number is inputted, if the plate number is available on the data base, driver's details and Ids displays below it. down the same page is a display screen.

also, there is a place a to flag plate numbers. upon flagging a particular plate number, it should be stored on the database or forwarded to admin screen.

The usermanagement page is where officers are registered and assigned a new password or VMIS Cold-code.
